BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impetus for the project was provided by a desire to use smbclient to publish
files on a Windows Server 2012 R2 share.  SCO-build samba 3.0.14a or 3.0.20a
releases do not support use of the SMB1 protocol disabled by default on newer
servers.  As the SMB1 protocol has severe vulnerabilities, enabling SMB1 was
not considered an option.

samba 3.6.x was the first version to support SMB2, so it was selected for
this effort, in part, because building top-of-tree versions of complex
software is often difficult for sco3.2v5.0.7 systems.

NOTE:  Version 4.x.x was not considered due to its use of the waf build system
       written in python.  At the time, python was not built on the project's
       sco3.2v5.0.7 build system, though later it was determined that building
       Python 2.5.6 was possible, and that Samba presently only requires
       Python 2.4.2 or later.

Initial effort involved use of samba-3.6.0.tar sources, but some difficulty
was encountered, so for a more in-depth build attempt, development moved to
use of the samba-3.6.25.tar release.

Upon the eventual successful building of source3/bin/smbclient, this project
was created publically share the modifications used to build the project on
sco3.2v5.0.7.

USE OF GNULIB
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once all compilation issues were resolved, the link by `make bin/smbclient`
failed due to lack of a strtoull function.  Build was only possible at all
when CFLAGS included -DHAVE_STRTOLL and -DHAVE_STRTULL.  Though the system
/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.4.0.1 and /usr/lib/libc-2.3.2.so shared objects did
contain plain-text strings "strtoll" and "strtoull" in what appeared to be
lists of exported functions, /usr/include headers did not mention them.

The project opted to supply strtoull() via gnulib rather than to address why
lib/replace/replace.c workarounds failed to work.  This fork, therefore, adds
related gnulib source files not present in the original project, and some
changes to autotools *.in files.

CAVEATS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This fork of the samba project modifies only the v3.6-stable branch for the
express purpose of improving compilation on sco3.2v5.0.7 operating systems.

This project (presently) aims only to tackle issues related to building and
using source3/bin/smbclient to interact with shares published by other
systems.  No attempt is made to build samba for use as a server.

Modifications to the v3.6-stable branch were made to expediciously produce a
sco3.2v5.0.7 binary.  Very little attempt was made to assure applicability
of the changes to other build platforms, and no attempt was made to assure
other builds were not broken.

While autotool *.in file modifications, particularly those related to import
of gnulib's strtoull, were viable for purposes of building on sco3.2v5.0.7, no
attempt was made to be sure the additions would not impact build on other
platforms.
